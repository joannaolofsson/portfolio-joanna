In this portfolio I use Styled Components instead of CSS. 

The portfolio is a work in progress and include a few of my educational cases, a little resume and som fun facts about me.

* Go to the main page https://github.com/jojjosthlm/portfolio-joanna
* Click on the green button, marked with <> code
* Copy the url
* Open Git Bash on windows or the terminal on mac
* Type cd to get to the place, where you want to place your file
* Type git clone and paste the url
* Type npm install to get the dependencies
* Type npm run dev to get a visual i crome

There are other ways to do it, but this is my best bet.
