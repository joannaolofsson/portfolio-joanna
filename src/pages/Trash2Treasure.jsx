                        <h2>Brief</h2>
                        <p>During spring 2024, I was part a challenge at my school Chas Academy. My class UX / UI designer with frontend skills
                            was divided into teams with a few of the other classes, from DevOps to design. Our objective was to design an app
                            under de theme "Green tech".</p> 
                            </StyledBrief>

                            </StyledCaseRole>

                        <h2>Challenges</h2>
                        <p>The biggest challenge of the project was that the different classes had a different amout of time 
                            allocated to this project. For instance, had DevOps only a few weeks in the beginning of the project. 
                        </p>
                        <p>I struggled alot during this project, trying to get everyone to communicate. The most important
                            challenge was though that I should ha pushed more for our group to decide on our rolls. Instead it
                            ended up with everyone wanting to make decisions on both design and coding in a very short amount 
                            of time and we lost time.</p>

                    <StyledContent2>
                        <h2>Our solution</h2>
                        <p>I do not think that anyone in our team was happy with the result. For me the frustration came from 
                            the requirements for my course to do UX / UI and frontend work. So in the end I had to submit 
                            extra design and coding work, for me to pass the cource.</p>

                        <p>This is probably the project from school that I learned the most from. I learned that I it's in my roll
                            as a UX/UI designer to make arguments for my design. I also learned that in such a short amout of
                            time it is important to make the scope small and set up clear rolls.
